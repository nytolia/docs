### Textures are so buggy, doesn't work?

By using a minecraft shader you override minecraft shaders, that means the resourcepack break because it's working with shaders. We recommend to play without a shader.

If you have some join problems, please open a ticket through our website. Please make also sure you don't use these mods/shaders:

* ViaFabric/Plus
* ImmediatelyFast
* other shaders or mods...
