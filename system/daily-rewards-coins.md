# 💸 Daily Rewards (Coins)

The Daily Rewards System allows players to claim a random number of coins each day by using the `/rewards` command. The number of coins awarded ranges from 10 to 200, with the chances of receiving higher amounts being significantly lower. Players can use this command on themselves or specify another player to receive the rewards.

### Command Usage

#### `/rewards`

When a player uses the `/rewards` command, they will receive a random amount of coins based on the chances outlined above. If no player is specified, the command will reward the player who issued the command.

### Cooldown

There is a 24-hour cooldown for claiming daily rewards. Once a player has claimed their reward, they must wait 24 hours before they can claim again.

### Claiming Rewards

Players must claim their daily rewards through an in-game menu. The command initiates the reward process, but players need to interact with the menu to finalize the claim and receive their coins.
